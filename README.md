# Make a set of projective cards
This generates a set of cards that can be used in place of Dobble cards. The set is complete, so that the various theorems on projective planes hold exactly.

Note that the SVG generated is not well interpreted by some packages; Inkscape and Vivaldi (and presumably therefore Chrome) perform fine with it.
